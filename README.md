This Web app is made as part of a school project and is later been used in demonstration purposes. 

The program writing has some shortcomings:
- Documentation is basically non-existent
- The code is extremely hard to follow and consists of overly long functions
- Some features are reused and therefore should be built in separate functions
- Code files are not validated
